### LinguaNet
LinguaNet is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to classify the linguistic origin of names. By leveraging sequence learning, this model predicts the language family or origin associated with a given name.

- RNN Architecture: Utilizes recurrent layers to process sequences of characters in names.
- Language Classification: Identifies the most likely linguistic origin from multiple categories.
- Training Data: Includes a dataset of names labeled by language origin.
